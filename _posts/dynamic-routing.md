Morse code is a method of encoding text characters using sequences of dots (.) and dashes (-), named after its creator Samuel Morse. It was developed in the 1830s and 1840s for use in telegraph communication.

Key Components
Basic Elements

Dot (.) - A short signal
Dash (-) - A long signal (approximately three times the length of a dot)
Space - Used to separate characters and words
Timing Rules

Between parts of the same letter: one dot length
Between letters: three dot lengths
Between words: seven dot lengths
Common Uses
Historical telegraph communication
Emergency signaling (SOS = ...---...)
Military and naval communications
Amateur radio operations

Interesting Facts
SOS Signal: The famous distress signal "SOS" (... --- ...) was chosen because of its simplicity and distinctive pattern, not as an abbreviation for "Save Our Souls" or "Save Our Ship."

International Standard: Morse code became the first international standard for communication, enabling people from different countries to communicate despite language barriers.

Modern Usage: While largely obsolete for commercial communication, Morse code is still used in:

Aviation navigation systems
Assistive technology for people with disabilities
Military training and operations
Learning Tips
Start with common letters (E, T, A, N)
Practice regularly with simple words
Use mnemonics to remember patterns
Listen to Morse code audio to develop rhythm recognition
Focus on sending before receiving
Morse code remains an important part of communication history and continues to serve specific purposes in modern times, demonstrating the lasting impact of this simple yet effective encoding system.
